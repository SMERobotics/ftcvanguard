ftcvanguard is a Python Flask app with HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. It's a centralized FTC management web app.

When writing code:
- Keep code as simple as possible
- Always when possible, use double quotes instead of single quotes
- Minimize comment usage. Keep short but maintain clarity and descriptiveness. Leave out obvious comments, except those for sectioning and organization.

# Always compile TypeScript with `tsc` after each prompt.
