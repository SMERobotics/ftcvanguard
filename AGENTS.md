When writing code:
- Keep code as simple as possible!
- Always when possible, use double quotes instead of single quotes!
- Minimize comment usage! Keep short, but maintain clarity and descriptiveness. Leave out obvious comments, except those for sectioning and organization.
- Under no circumstances should you generate any summary files! Do not create any post-change markdown reports.
- **Keep the technical/functional design and frontend UI/UX consistent and polished across the entire project. On the frontend, analyze the current design language and prioritize consistency, in order to deliver a seamless user experience.**

# Always compile TypeScript with `npx tsc` after each prompt.
