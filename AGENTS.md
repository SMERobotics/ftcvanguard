ftcvanguard is a Python Flask app with HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. It is a centralized First Tech Challenge Robotics management web app. Its goal is to provide streamlined, realtime data, enabling rapid strategic insights.

When writing code:
- Keep code as simple as possible
- Always when possible, use double quotes instead of single quotes
- Minimize comment usage. Keep short but maintain clarity and descriptiveness. Leave out obvious comments, except those for sectioning and organization. 
- - **Keep the technical/functional program design and UI/UX consistent and polished across the entire project. On the frontend, analyze the current design language constant with the rest of the user experience.**
- Never generate any summary detail files, and only provide feedback on the actual functional changes made in the current session.


# Always compile TypeScript with `npx tsc` after each prompt.
